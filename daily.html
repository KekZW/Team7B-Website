        <h5>22/7/2025</h5>
        <p>In the morning, we conducted a lecture on the importance of asking the right questions. From there our team decided to sit together and brainstorm some questions, mainly focusing on clarifying the questions that we had about the questions statement.</p>
        <p>Some of the questions we had are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who is the target audience, who is going to use</li>
          <li>What does river condition mean?</li>
          <li>Are there any other data sources that we can use, other than SEPA as it seems limited.</li>
          <li>What are the main concerns that we should be looking out for?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>During the meeting, we also gave out suggestions of possible solutions, which was an easy-to-use mobile application. While the partner was receptive to this idea, she also suggested we look into Information Display Systems that are used on beaches to tell the public basic information.</p>

        <p>After the meeting, we decided to first consolidate our findings from the meeting into a list in order to prevent any one person from being out of the loop and ended the day there.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="day2" role="tabpanel">
            <h5>23/7/2025</h5>
            <p>After lecutre, we came together and list out all possible ideas during a group discussion where we came with:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Mobile Application</li>
                <li>Information Display System</li>
                <li>QR Code + Website</li>
              </ul>  
              <p>Even though we did not draw each ideas out, we did come togther and discuss the pros and cons of each idea. 
              We focused mainly on the cost effectiveness and also usability of the ideas.</p>
            <p>In the end, we chose to create a mobile application, as it was the most cost effective and is able to meet the requirements set by the partner. However, most importantly it will allow for quick and easy access to the information without the need of heading down to the actual river.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="day3" role="tabpanel">
            <h5>24/7/2025</h5>
            <p>We first created a storyboard to better understand how the app should work, using online resources we were able to create a general process flow to better understand and see how the product should work.</p>
            <img src="images/StoryBoard.png" alt="Storyboard" width="800"/>
            <p>After that, we created a low fidelity prototype on figma to visualize the app's possible layout and functionality.</p>
            <p>The features are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>General Safety Information</li>
              <li>Current Water Level</li>
              <li>Charts that show both historical data and also prediction</li>
              <li>Current Water Flow</li>
              <li>Latest River Pollution Data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the creation, we decided to refine it a bit and also end the day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="day4" role="tabpanel">
            <h5>25/7/2025</h5>
            <p>We had a lecture regarding prototyping this morning, as such we were able to use what 
              we learn to finetune our low fidelity prototype. At first we focus on making the feature, 
              but we now know that we should make a bad product, to understand the pain points better to 
              better create a new prototype.</p>
            <p>From here, we tested our prototypes within the group, knowing that the prototype is mainly for testing our ideas, we kept testing to find issues with our initial prototype.</p>
            <p>We also created a list of issues that we found with the prototype, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Confusing charts</li>
              <li>Hard to navigate</li>
              <li>Difficulty in understanding the rationale behind one of the features (taking photo)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>From here, we planned out on what can be used and what must be fixed in our high fidelity. However, what we focus more on about was the pitch video as it was due to this day. </p>
            <p>Throughout the week, we had already created a powerpoint presentation and so while some of us were planning out the high fidelity prototype, others were working on the presentation and scripts.</p>

            <h5>28/07/2025</h5>
            <p>We began the day by first confirming the features that we wanted to have in our product and then began the creation of our high fidelity prototype.
              We similar used figma to design and plan out the nevigation of the app, through out the development, 
              we faced some issues as we did not really understand how to use the more advanced features of figma. However, luckly the internet is there to help us and we were able to create a inital high fidelity prototype.</p>
            <img src="images/Hi-Fi(Initial).jpg" alt="Hi-Fi(Initial)" width="800"/>
            <p>After the creation, we spotted some issue with the navigation and also how it should start up, from there we began further discussion to get everyone on the same page and also to vote on what should be done</p>
            <p>We also found out that the pollution chart might be a little too confusing from people to understand, as such we began creating another home screen to try do an A/B testing</p>

            <p>The current issue that we have now is that we need client feadback to better improve our prototypes.</p>
