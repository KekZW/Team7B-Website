                  <p class="content-paragraph">In the morning, we attended a lecture on the importance of asking the right questions. From there our team decided to sit together and brainstorm some questions, mainly focusing on clarifying the questions that we had about the questions statement.</p>
                  
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Some of the questions we had are:</p>
                  <ul class="content-list">
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Who is the target audience, who is going to use</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">What does river condition mean?</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Are there any other data sources that we can use, other than SEPA as it seems limited.</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">What are the main concerns that we should be looking out for?</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">In the afternoon, we met our project partner, Sally from Friends of River Kelvin. The partner meeting have helped us in clarifying and understanding the whole project. Additionally, we got a chance to learn something new regarding the river through the discussion with Sally. We were quite glad that we were able to use what we learnt in class in action and was able to drill down the problem statement to better understand and fine-tune the requirements.</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">During the meeting, we also gave out suggestions of possible solutions, which was an easy-to-use mobile application. While the partner was receptive to this idea, she also suggested we look into Information Display Systems that are used on beaches to tell the public basic information.</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">After the meeting, we decided to first consolidate our findings from the meeting into a list in order to prevent any one person from being out of the loop and ended the day there.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="day2" role="tabpanel">
                  <h5 class="day-title">23/7/2025</h5>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">After lecture, we came together and list out all possible ideas during a group discussion where we came with:</p>
                  <ul class="content-list">
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Mobile Application</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Information Display System</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">QR Code + Website</li>
                  </ul>  

                  <p>The following are images of the brainstorming:</p>

                  </div>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">After the brainstorming, we decided to do some research on the different ideas that we had and drawing it out, we dicuss regarding the feasibility of each idea and also the cost of making the product.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Based on what we see, the idea that cost the most would be the Information Display System (need setup and constant power source), followed by Website (need hosting) and lastly the mobile app.</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">We first created a storyboard to better understand how the app should work, using online resources we were able to create a general process flow to better understand and see how the product should work.</p>
                  <img src="images/StoryBoard.png" alt="Storyboard" class="content-image" width="800"/>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">After that, we created a low fidelity prototype on figma to visualize the app's possible layout and functionality.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">The features are:</p>
                  <ul class="content-list">
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">General Safety Information</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Current Water Level</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Charts that show both historical data and also prediction</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Current Water Flow</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Latest River Pollution Data</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Even though we had created a low fidelity prototype, we knew that there was still a lot of work to be done before it could be considered a viable product, as such we spend the rest of the day refining the prototype, removing while also adding to hopefully meet the requirements set by the partner</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">We also conducted our first round of groundworking, where we visited the River Kelvin after school to learn more about the place</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">We had a lecture regarding prototyping this morning, as such we were able to use what we learn to finetune our low fidelity prototype. At first we focus on making the feature, but we now know that we should make a bad product, to understand the pain points better to better create a new prototype.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">From here, we tested our prototypes within the group, knowing that the prototype is mainly for testing our ideas, we kept testing to find issues with our initial prototype.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">We also created a list of issues that we found with the prototype, such as:</p>
                  <ul class="content-list">
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Confusing charts</li>

                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Difficulty in understanding the rationale behind one of the features (taking photo)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">From here, we planned out on what can be used and what must be fixed in our high fidelity. However, what we focus more on about was the pitch video as it was due to this day.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Throughout the week, we had already created a powerpoint presentation and so while some of us were planning out the high fidelity prototype, others were working on the presentation and scripts.</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">We began the day by first confirming the features that we wanted to have in our product and then began the creation of our high fidelity prototype. We similar used figma to design and plan out the navigation of the app, through out the development, we faced some issues as we did not really understand how to use the more advanced features of figma. However, luckily the internet is there to help us and we were able to create a initial high fidelity prototype.</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">After the creation, we spotted some issue with the navigation and also how it should start up, from there we began further discussion to get everyone on the same page and also to vote on what should be done</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">We also found out that the pollution chart might be a little too confusing from people to understand, as such we began creating another home screen to try do an A/B testing</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">The current issue that we have now is that we need client feedback to better improve our prototypes.</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">Today we received the feedback for our first pitch video, it was mostly positive, however the issue came with the understanding of the problem statement and also the project requirements, where we did not show enough regarding the forecasting and prediction of river kelvin. As such we decided to include them into our high fidelity prototype, making it more obvious for users to use and predict future conditions.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">We also have started the initial draft of our poster, which is currently a work in progress, where we plan to focus more on selling the product than explaining what it does.</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">We continue redesigning the app, mainly changing how the forecasting works. After doing some internal test run, we found out that the readability of the forecast was not that good, as such we tested different version and settle for one that just overrides the entire page to the forecast frame.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Our group have come to the understanding that no matter what there is still rooms for improvement and also that we should keep refining the prototype until it is more usable and when we are satisfied with it.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">We were also able to create a second draft of the poster and also created a logo for our mobile application.</p>

                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">We need to think about ways to reach out to people, ask why would they use this app?</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">It would be nice if there are QR codes to link to both our Instagram and website.</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">We should consider adding a news section to keep users updated.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">We also discussed about the methods they uses for pollution checking and how it should be integrates with our app.</p>

                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">The label are confusing, there should be a way for us to know what each of them means</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Some of the charts were clipping through</li>
                    <li style="--bulletcol: #008B8Bff;">Talking about the community tabs, there should be a way to click into it as there is no way for them to scan the QR as it is a mobile app</li>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">Today, we were unable to meet in school as planned due to a weather alert, which led to the cancellation of on-campus activities. Despite this unexpected disruption, our group adapted by conducting the discussion virtually from our accommodation. We focused primarily on finalizing the poster design for the project.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Although we encountered some initial challenges in coordinating the discussion and sharing ideas effectively in a remote setting, we managed to overcome them by staying flexible and maintaining clear communication. Through collaboration and compromise, we successfully refined and completed the final version of our poster. This experience highlighted the importance of adaptability and teamwork, especially when working under unexpected limitations.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Shown below are the two new designs we've worked on. We all agrees that using the real River Kelvin image (instead of vector) looks nicer. The differences between the two is that the latter ones uses a tinted background. Our team will discuss in-depth tomorrow on which design is more appropriate for our target users.</p>

It was agreed among the group that, the poster is not easy to follow for a person without context. Therefore, we added numbering to the poster to help guide the user through the poster.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">We then proceed with the voting phase which resulted in the first poster being voted majoritively. However, we did not just select the first poster. Learning from the Mental Model lecture, we asked the minority group on why they prefer the second poster. After much discussion, our group made some changes that integrates elements from the second posters, and use it as our final design.</p>

We mainly focus on trying to match the color scheme of the website to match that of Friends of River Kelvin and also river in general.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">We made the website using:</p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">We also made sure to add the pitch video and also the poster to the website, so that it can be easily accessible.</p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">Currently, the issues we faced is just the interactivity of the site, as we are only allowed static website and our group wanted to keep the design and website coding as minimal as possible.</p>

                  <h5 style="font-weight: bolder;">Stakeholder Reflections</h5>

                  <h5><u>1st Partner Meeting</u></h5>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    The first stakeholder meeting was a turning point in shaping our project. Using questioning techniques from our lectures, we were able to ask targeted questions that clarified both the problem statement and the requirements. This gave us a deeper understanding of the user’s needs and helped us start shaping a product that could truly meet them.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Brainstorming on the spot showed us how valuable it is to share ideas early, even if they’re rough, we found that one suggestion often sparked others. Learning about the river’s current condition also made the project feel more meaningful, as we could now see the real-world impact our work might have.
                  </p>

                  <h5><u>2nd Partner Meeting</u></h5>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    By the second meeting, we felt more confident presenting our high-fidelity prototype. The feedback we received wasn’t just about fixing issues, it was also a lot of suggestions of features that we did not know that we needed at first. By talking to the partner, it helped us really understand the main purpose of the project, which is to communicate to the public about what is going on with River Kelvin
                  </p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Overall, these meetings taught me that effective communication and active listening are just as important as technical skills. In future projects, I’ll apply this approach early to ensure our solutions align closely with stakeholder needs.
                  </p>

                  <hr/>
                  <br>

                  <h5 style="font-weight: bolder;">Product Reflection</h5>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    We began by brainstorming and sketching ideas on paper. Although simple, this made it easier to discuss and refine concepts before committing to a detailed design. We decided on a mobile application to provide real-time information about the River Kelvin, with additional features like historical data, forecasts, and safety information.
                  </p>

                  <h5><u>Lo-Fi Prototype</u></h5>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Creating the low-fidelity prototype in Figma allowed us to focus on structure and usability without worrying about visuals. Because it was low commitment, we could test, receive feedback, and discard ideas without hesitation. Internal testing quickly revealed confusing charts and navigation issues, which we were able to address before investing more time.
                  </p>

                  <h5><u>Hi-Fi Prototype</u></h5>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Building the high-fidelity prototype brought the design closer to reality, but also introduced challenges. A disagreement about the login system initially split the team, but instead of voting, we used integrative thinking to find a compromise, which was that we only require logins only for sensitive features. This experience taught me that conflict, if approached constructively, can lead to better solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Usability testing with classmates and our partner exposed issues we hadn’t noticed, such as unclear labels and poor navigation flow. Addressing these not only improved the product but also reinforced the importance of testing with real users. Documenting all feedback and changes ensured a smoother handover to the development phase, something we are sure that we will make standard practice in future projects.
                  </p>

                  <hr/>

                  <h5 style="font-weight: bolder;">Overall</h5>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    This project was a great learning experience for our team. We faced challenges in understanding the problem statement and requirements, but through brainstorming and discussions, we were able to clarify our goals. The iterative process of prototyping helped us refine our ideas and create a more user-friendly product.
                  </p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Overall, we are proud of the final product and the skills we developed throughout this project. We learned the importance of gathering feedback from both partners and peers to improve our design. Most importantly, we were able to apply the concepts and skills we learned throughout the OIP into real-life projects.
                  </p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    We are dismayed that we were not able to produce a working mobile application in this three weeks time frame. However, we are confident that the design and features we developed will be valuable for future iterations of the project. We hope that our work will contribute to improving river safety and awareness not just for River Kelvin, but the entire community.
                  </p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Finally, we would like to thank our project partner, Friends of River Kelvin, for their support and guidance throughout this project. Their insights and feedback were invaluable in shaping our design and ensuring that we met the needs of the community.
                  </p>

                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Working in on this project was a great learning experience for me. While I have done projects that involve real life clients and solving real life problems (PSD/TP), this project was different as it involved external partner that is not from Singapore. This made me realize the importance of understanding the local context and how it can affect the design and development of a product.

                    Initially, I thought we would be developing a working prototype, but as we progressed, I realized that the focus of this module was more on the design and planning aspects. This shift in focus allowed me to understand the importance of user-centered design and how to create a product that meets the needs of the users. For example, the 1st lecture conducted taught me how to effectively craft good questions. Therefore, during the first meeting with our project partner, I was able to ask the right questions to clarify the problem statement and requirements. This helped my team to better understand the needs of the users and create a more user-friendly product.

                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Additionally, the iterative process of prototyping helped us refine our ideas and create a more user-friendly product. We learned the importance of gathering feedback from both partners and peers to improve our design. For example, during the usability testing, we were able to identify issues with the navigation and readability of the charts. This feedback allowed us to make necessary changes to improve the user experience.

                    As a Year 2 Computing Science student, I’ve worked on several projects, but this one stood out—similar to a previous module, PSD, where we had to interact with a customer. It made me think more deeply about real user needs. Even though it was just a frontend design, we had to consider how people interact with river safety data in a clear and accessible way.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Working with my teammates was smooth. We split the work based on our strengths and continuously refined our ideas together. The pitch videos gave me a chance to reflect on what I learned in class and to showcase our progress in a short 5-minute format especially when it came to communicating our design clearly. By the second video, we improved a lot. Thanks to the feedback from our marker, we presented our ideas more confidently and clearly.
                  </p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                    Creating the poster helped bring everything together visually and allowed us to reflect on the full design journey. This project reminded me that even simple interfaces can make a real difference when built with purpose and with the user in mind.

                    This project was an interesting experience. Although not the first time we (the year 2 CS students) were exposed to an external party during our curriculum (some if not most of us would have already had this experience from the 'Team Project' module), being exposed to an external party in an unfamiliar environment was a novel experience.

                    I personally faced various challenges along the way such a lack of familiarity with the local (Glasgow/UK) context, the time constraints of the project, needing time to settle into a different environment, falling sick .etc and through it all I am glad to have come out more enriched. In the highly globalized world of today, experiences like these will be sure to come in handy - especially in a metropolitan environment like the one back in Singapore.

                      While this is not the first project that we did, that involves real life clients and solving real life problems/project (PSD/TP). Even so, it was a good learning experience as this was a completely different setting as compared to Singapore. Initially, it was difficult to adjust throughout the OIP as it was completely different as to how teaching was back in Singapore.

Even though most of us have mostly the same idea, each of us have different ways of designing and also how to implement, this shows how each of us had different mental model of the same idea. Through communications and collaboration, we were able to iron out each of our mental model and into a shared mental model, getting everyone on the same page.

                      Working on this project is very exciting for me as it is my first time working at a different location and on a venue that is not related to Singapore. This project helps to bring out my creative side as I have to think outside of the box for a solution that is related to a venue I am not familiar with.

                        The chemistry between me and my team was not new as we worked on a previous module as a whole group before as well. Therefore, picking up from where we left off was easy. As mentioned, the problem regarding the River Kelvin was new to us. We, as a group, went down to explore the place so that we could learn more about the River Kelvin and think of more feasible solutions.                  </p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                        The entire process from brainstorming to creating a prototype was completely new to me as it involves a stakeholder. This experience cannot be recreated just by sitting on our campus back in Singapore. Therefore, I really appreciate the entire process of this project. Communicating with the stakeholder has been a pleasant experience as she was very helpful and informative about the River Kelvin.                  </p>
                  <p class="content-paragraph">
                        Ultimately, this project allows me to understand more about problem-solving. It taught me that solving a problem does not just include creating a problem statement and solving it. I should actively include the involved parties to make sure that the solution is actually what they want.                  </p>
